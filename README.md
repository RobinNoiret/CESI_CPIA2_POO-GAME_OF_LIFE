# Game of Life - Cellular Automaton Simulation Project in C++

## 📝 Project Description
Implementation of John Conway's famous "Game of Life" in C++. This project aims to create a cellular automaton simulation with two different execution modes, allowing observation of cell evolution according to predefined rules.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop an object-oriented architecture in C++
- Implement two distinct user interfaces (console and graphical)
- Manage data persistence (file reading/writing)
- Create a configurable and efficient simulation

## 💻 Solution Location
The solution can be found in the `sandbox` folder.

## 🔨 Features to Implement
### Console Mode:
- Reading initial state from a file
- Generation of the first n iterations
- Export results to separate files

### Graphical Mode:
- User interface with interactive grid
- Configurable simulation
- Evolution display

## 📋 Technical Specifications
- Language: C++
- Graphical Interface: SFML
- Data Format: Text files with specific format
- Architecture: Object-oriented
